PaunaStepper Library for Arduino
================================

PaunaStepper is a library for use with 4-wire hobby stepper motors. It is mainly oriented
to low-cost stepper such as model 28BYJ-48 5v with ULN2003. The main feature that differentiates 
this library from similar ones is that it uses interrupts to control the steppers and can control
more than one stepper in a similar way to the Servo library. This allows, for example, to control 
the speed and direction of the steppers at the same time as the delay () functions and serial 
communication without the need to constantly call an update function or use the blocking mode.

PaunaStepper uses the arduino UNO TIMER2, so it is not possible to use tone () at the same time. 
However, other non-blocking libraries can be used without interruption to generate tones.

*PAUNA means child in Kunza (aka Atacame√±o), one of the languages spoken by some of the native 
peoples of northern Chile (South America).
